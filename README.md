# PoECheatSheet
PoECheatSheet is a personal project in which I am learning HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to create a working website that can be used by other people (namely friends).

PoECheatSheet's goal as a website is to provide a consolidated source of information for Path of Exile players. The goal is not to provide a learning environment or a beginners guide, but a one-stop-shop for all of your on-the-fly references. A way to use a single link to have a veriety of cheatsheets and references available to you during your gameplay. Otherwise, all of this information is out there, but spread far and wide accross the internet. 

If you have any development ideas, reference ideas, or would like to contribute- please contact me or use the Help Me button on the navbar and join the Discord.

Thank you.
